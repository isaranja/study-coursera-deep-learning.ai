This is the course I have enjoyed lot. Andrew Ng did a wonderful job for explaining deep learning from the scratch to very advanced level.
Course is devided in to five parts

## Part 1 : Neura Networks and Deep Learning
## Part 2 : Improving Deep Neural Networks Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
## Part 3 : Convolutional Neural Networks
## Part 4 : Sequence Models
## Part 5 : Structuring Machine Learning Projects

Since coursera asked not to share the codes, I decided to remove course material from public. I will keep it in private mode.
If you need any help, let me know.
